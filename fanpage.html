      <h3>The greatest set on the greatest stage...Wembley Stadium in 1985</h3>
      <p>
        Their iconic status, in question only by the skeptical few, was cemented
        by their performance at Live Aid in 1985. An all day concert, Live Aid
        was a music industry telethon designed to raise awareness of, and money
        for, victims of the famine in Africa. With stages in the US (JFK Stadium
        in Philadelphia) and the UK (Wembley Stadium in London), highlighted by
        super acts like David Bowie, U2, and Elton John, Queen was relegated to
        the 7pm slot, well before sunset on a very warm day in July!! Even the
        sun couldn't outshine the most memorable performance of the '80s, on the
        largest stage in music history.

      <p>Here is a quick video on the performance:</p>
